        "brief_summary": "Specifies when the Regulation applies to processing of personal data and lists categories of processing that are excluded from its scope, including activities outside Union law, certain Member State activities under TEU Title V, purely personal/household activities, and processing by competent authorities for criminal law enforcement/public security purposes.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This section sets the material scope by defining covered processing operations and explicit exclusions. Covered processing includes (i) processing of personal data \"wholly or partly by automated means\" and (ii) non-automated processing of personal data that \"form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\" The section then provides a closed list of exclusions where the Regulation \"does not apply\" to processing of personal data: (a) processing \"in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law\"; (b) processing \"by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU\"; (c) processing \"by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity\"; and (d) processing \"by competent authorities\" for specified criminal justice and public security purposes (prevention, investigation, detection, prosecution of criminal offences; execution of criminal penalties; safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security). The section also clarifies that for processing by Union institutions/bodies/offices/agencies, a different instrument applies (Regulation (EC) No 45/2001), and that this instrument and other applicable Union legal acts for such processing \"shall be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation\" in accordance with Article 98. Finally, it states the Regulation is \"without prejudice\" to Directive 2000/31/EC, particularly intermediary service provider liability rules in Articles 12–15 of that Directive.",
        "purpose": "To delineate precisely which personal data processing activities fall under the Regulation and to prevent misapplication to excluded domains (e.g., household activities, certain state security/law enforcement activities, and EU institutions governed by a separate regime).",

        "detailed_explanation": "This section establishes that processing of personal data is lawful only if at least one enumerated legal basis applies. It lists six lawful bases: consent for specific purposes; necessity for contract performance or pre-contract steps requested by the data subject; necessity for compliance with a legal obligation; necessity to protect vital interests; necessity for a public interest task or exercise of official authority; and necessity for legitimate interests of the controller/third party subject to an overriding-rights test, with heightened emphasis where the data subject is a child. It further prohibits public authorities from relying on the legitimate interests basis when processing is carried out in the performance of their tasks. For processing based on legal obligation or public task/official authority, it requires that the legal basis be laid down in Union or Member State law and that the purpose be determined in that legal basis (or be necessary for the public task/authority). It allows Union/Member State law to include specific provisions adapting GDPR application (e.g., types of data, data subjects, disclosures, purpose limitation, storage periods, operations/procedures, and measures ensuring lawful and fair processing) and requires such law to meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Finally, it imposes a mandatory compatibility assessment for further processing for a new purpose when that further processing is not based on consent or on qualifying Union/Member State law meeting Article 23(1) safeguards; the controller must consider specified factors (link between purposes, context/relationship, nature of data including special categories/criminal data, consequences, and safeguards such as encryption/pseudonymisation).",

Member States may legislate a lower age for these purposes, but the lower age cannot be below 13.

        "brief_summary": "Imposes detailed procedural and transparency requirements on controllers for providing GDPR information and handling data subject rights requests, including format, language, timelines, free-of-charge principle, conditions for fees/refusal, identity verification, and optional standardized icons.",
        "detailed_explanation": "The provision requires controllers to implement appropriate measures to deliver GDPR information (Articles 13 and 14) and communications/actions related to data subject rights (Articles 15–22) and personal data breach communications (Article 34) in a manner that is concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible, using clear and plain language, with special emphasis on child-directed information. It establishes permissible delivery channels (written or other means including electronic; oral upon request with identity proven). It mandates facilitation of rights exercise and limits refusal to act, particularly where Article 11(2) applies, unless the controller can demonstrate inability to identify the data subject. It sets strict response deadlines (without undue delay and within one month), allows a defined extension (up to two additional months) based on complexity/number of requests, and requires timely notice of extension with reasons. It requires electronic responses where requests are made electronically, where possible, unless the data subject requests otherwise. If no action is taken, the controller must notify the data subject within one month with reasons and inform them of complaint and judicial remedy options. It establishes that information/communications/actions under specified articles must be free of charge, with a narrow exception for manifestly unfounded or excessive requests (especially repetitive), allowing either a reasonable fee (administrative costs-based) or refusal; the controller bears the burden of demonstrating the request is manifestly unfounded/excessive. It permits controllers to request additional information to confirm identity where there are reasonable doubts (without prejudice to Article 11). It allows combining Articles 13/14 information with standardized icons to provide a meaningful overview, and requires machine-readability when icons are presented electronically. It empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts (per Article 92) to determine icon information and procedures.",

        "detailed_explanation": "The section provides actionable rules governing when and how a data subject may object to processing and what the controller must do in response. For processing based on Article 6(1)(e) (task in the public interest/exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests), the data subject may object at any time on grounds relating to their particular situation, including where the processing involves profiling based on those legal bases. Upon such objection, the controller must stop processing unless it can demonstrate either (i) compelling legitimate grounds overriding the data subject’s interests, rights and freedoms, or (ii) that processing is needed for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims. Separately, where processing is for direct marketing, the data subject has a right to object at any time, including to profiling insofar as it relates to direct marketing; once the objection is made, the controller must cease processing for direct marketing purposes (no balancing test is stated in this section for direct marketing). The controller must also ensure the right to object (for both the general objection right and the direct marketing objection right) is explicitly brought to the data subject’s attention no later than the time of the first communication, and that it is presented clearly and separately from other information. For information society services, the data subject may exercise the right to object by automated means using technical specifications, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC. Finally, for processing for scientific or historical research or statistical purposes under Article 89(1), the data subject has a right to object on grounds relating to their particular situation unless the processing is necessary for performing a task carried out for reasons of public interest.",
        "purpose": "To give individuals control over certain types of processing—especially processing based on public task/official authority or legitimate interests, and direct marketing—by enabling them to object and requiring controllers to stop processing unless specific overriding conditions apply.",

It then enumerates three circumstances where this right/prohibition does not apply: where the decision is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with the data subject; where the decision is authorized by Union or Member State law applicable to the controller and that law also provides suitable safeguards; or where the decision is based on the data subject’s explicit consent. Where the controller relies on the contract-necessity or explicit-consent bases, the controller must implement suitable safeguards, at minimum ensuring the data subject can obtain human intervention, express their point of view, and contest the decision. Finally, it restricts the use of special categories of personal data as inputs/bases for such decisions unless specific Article 9(2) conditions apply (point (a) or (g)) and suitable safeguards are in place.",

        "detailed_explanation": "The provision requires controllers to proactively build compliance into processing operations. It mandates a risk- and context-based approach that considers (i) state of the art, (ii) cost of implementation, (iii) nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, and (iv) risks to rights and freedoms of natural persons (likelihood and severity). Controllers must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures at two points in time: when determining the means of processing (design/architecture stage) and during the processing itself (operational stage). Measures must be designed to implement data-protection principles (explicitly including data minimisation) effectively and to integrate necessary safeguards to meet the Regulation’s requirements and protect data subjects’ rights. Separately, controllers must ensure privacy-by-default: default configurations and practices must ensure only personal data necessary for each specific purpose are processed, covering the amount collected, extent of processing, storage period, and accessibility. A specific default-accessibility safeguard is required: by default, personal data must not be made accessible to an indefinite number of natural persons without the individual’s intervention. The section also provides that an approved certification mechanism under Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with these obligations.",

It prohibits processors from engaging sub-processors without the controller’s prior written authorization (specific or general), and requires notice of changes under general authorization to allow controller objection. It mandates that processing by a processor be governed by a binding contract or other legal act under Union/Member State law, specifying key processing parameters and including a minimum set of processor obligations: processing only on documented controller instructions (including for transfers), confidentiality commitments, implementation of Article 32 measures, compliance with sub-processing conditions, assistance with data subject rights requests, assistance with compliance with Articles 32–36, deletion/return of data at end of services (unless law requires storage), and making information available plus supporting audits/inspections. The processor must also immediately inform the controller if an instruction infringes GDPR or other Union/Member State data protection provisions. When a processor engages a sub-processor, it must impose the same data protection obligations via contract/legal act and ensure sufficient guarantees; the initial processor remains fully liable to the controller if the sub-processor fails. Adherence to approved codes of conduct (Art. 40) or approved certification mechanisms (Art. 42) may be used to demonstrate sufficient guarantees. Contracts may be based on standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission or supervisory authorities, and must be in writing (including electronic). Finally, if a processor determines purposes and means, it is considered a controller for that processing (without prejudice to Articles 82–84).",

Default rule: the processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor who has access to personal data may process that data only when acting on the controller’s instructions. This creates an instruction-bound processing model and restricts discretionary processing by staff, contractors, and other authorized persons. Exception: if a Union or Member State law requires processing, the instruction limitation does not apply to the extent of that legal requirement. The condition is tied to (1) access to personal data, (2) acting under the authority of the controller or processor, and (3) processing activity. The rule functions as an internal governance and access/authorization control requirement: access alone does not permit processing; processing must be instruction-based unless legally mandated otherwise.",

Controllers must maintain a record of processing activities under their responsibility containing a defined set of data points (identity/contact details, purposes, categories of data subjects and personal data, recipients including third-country/international organization recipients, transfer details and safeguards documentation in certain Article 49(1) cases, envisaged erasure time limits where possible, and a general description of Article 32(1) security measures where possible).

Records must be in writing (including electronic form). Controllers/processors (and where applicable their representatives) must make the record available to the supervisory authority upon request. A size-based exemption applies to enterprises/organisations employing fewer than 250 persons, but the exemption is removed if processing is likely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms, is not occasional, or includes special categories of data (Article 9(1)) or criminal conviction/offence data (Article 10).",

        "brief_summary": "Requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of personal data processing proportionate to risk, and to control how authorized persons process personal data.",
        "detailed_explanation": "The provision mandates a risk-based approach to security of processing. Controllers and processors must consider (i) state of the art, (ii) implementation costs, (iii) nature/scope/context/purposes of processing, and (iv) risks to individuals’ rights and freedoms (likelihood and severity). Based on this assessment, they must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a security level appropriate to the risk. The article provides a non-exhaustive list of measures that may be appropriate: pseudonymisation and encryption; ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems/services; ability to restore availability and access to personal data in a timely manner after incidents; and a process for regular testing/assessment/evaluation of measure effectiveness. It further specifies that security level assessment must particularly consider risks from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data (whether transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed). It allows adherence to an approved code of conduct (Art. 40) or approved certification mechanism (Art. 42) as an element to demonstrate compliance with paragraph 1. Finally, it requires controllers and processors to ensure that any natural person acting under their authority who has access to personal data processes it only on controller instructions, unless Union or Member State law requires otherwise.",

If notification is not made within 72 hours, the controller must provide reasons for the delay.

Where it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the controller may provide the information in phases, but must do so without undue further delay.

        "brief_summary": "Requires controllers to perform a DPIA before processing likely to result in high risk to individuals, specifies when a DPIA is particularly required, prescribes minimum DPIA content, and sets related obligations involving the DPO, supervisory authorities, and periodic review.",
        "detailed_explanation": "The provision obliges a controller to conduct, before starting certain processing, an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data when the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly when using new technologies and considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes. It allows a single DPIA to cover a set of similar operations with similar high risks. It requires the controller to seek advice from the data protection officer (if designated) during the DPIA. It identifies three specific scenarios where a DPIA is in particular required: (a) systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects based on automated processing (including profiling) where decisions produce legal effects or similarly significantly affect individuals; (b) large-scale processing of special categories of data (Article 9(1)) or criminal convictions/offences data (Article 10); and (c) systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale. It mandates supervisory authorities to publish lists of processing operations requiring a DPIA and to communicate those lists to the European Data Protection Board (Article 68), and permits supervisory authorities to publish lists of operations not requiring a DPIA, also communicated to the Board. Before adopting such lists, the competent supervisory authority must apply the GDPR consistency mechanism (Article 63) where the lists involve cross-border-related processing (offering goods/services or monitoring behaviour in several Member States) or may substantially affect free movement of personal data within the Union. The DPIA must contain at least four elements: a systematic description of processing and purposes (including legitimate interest where applicable), an assessment of necessity and proportionality, an assessment of risks to rights and freedoms, and measures to address risks (including safeguards, security measures, and mechanisms to ensure protection and demonstrate compliance, considering rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and others). Compliance with approved codes of conduct (Article 40) must be taken into due account in assessing impact, particularly for DPIAs. Where appropriate, the controller must seek views of data subjects or their representatives on intended processing, without prejudice to protection of commercial/public interests or security of processing operations. An exemption applies where processing under Article 6(1)(c) or (e) has a legal basis in Union or Member State law that regulates the specific processing and a DPIA has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment during adoption of that legal basis; in that case, paragraphs 1 to 7 do not apply unless Member States deem a DPIA necessary prior to processing. Finally, where necessary, the controller must review to assess whether processing is performed in accordance with the DPIA at least when there is a change in the risk represented by the processing operations.",
        "purpose": "To ensure high-risk processing is assessed and mitigated before it begins, embedding privacy/data protection by design through structured risk identification, proportionality analysis, and documented safeguards.",
        "legislative_intent": "To prevent or reduce harm to individuals’ rights and freedoms from high-risk processing (especially new technologies, large-scale sensitive data, profiling, and monitoring) by requiring prior assessment, transparency of high-risk categories via supervisory authority lists, and ongoing review when risk changes."

The controller must provide specified information (including roles/responsibilities, purposes/means, safeguards, DPO contact details where applicable, the DPIA, and any other information requested).

It also permits organizational flexibility by allowing a single DPO for a group of undertakings if accessibility from each establishment is ensured, and allowing a single DPO for multiple public authorities/bodies considering organizational structure and size. Outside the mandatory triggers, it allows voluntary designation and requires designation where Union or Member State law so requires, including via associations representing categories of controllers/processors. The DPO must be selected based on professional qualities, especially expert knowledge of data protection law/practices and ability to perform tasks referenced in Article 39.

        "brief_summary": "Establishes a framework for developing, approving, monitoring, publishing, and granting EU-wide validity to GDPR codes of conduct, including their use as appropriate safeguards for international transfers in certain cases.",
        "detailed_explanation": "The article requires EU institutions and Member States’ authorities to encourage sector- and size-sensitive codes of conduct to support proper GDPR application. It authorizes representative associations/bodies of controllers or processors to draft, amend, or extend codes specifying GDPR application across enumerated topics (e.g., transparency, legitimate interests, breach notification, transfers, children’s information/consent). It permits adherence by entities not subject to GDPR (outside Article 3 scope) to approved codes with EU-wide general validity, as a mechanism to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers under Article 46(2)(e), provided they make binding and enforceable commitments via contractual or other legally binding instruments, including regarding data subject rights. It mandates that codes include mechanisms enabling an Article 41(1) monitoring body to perform mandatory compliance monitoring, without prejudice to supervisory authorities’ powers. It sets a supervisory authority submission and approval process, including registration/publication for single-Member-State processing, and a consistency mechanism involving the EDPB for multi-Member-State processing. It provides for Commission implementing acts to grant general validity across the Union, requires Commission publicity for such codes, and requires the Board to maintain a public register of all approved codes/amendments/extensions.",
        "purpose": "To operationalize GDPR compliance through sectoral and practical standards (codes) that specify how GDPR applies in particular contexts, and to create a supervised, transparent system for approval, monitoring, and EU-wide recognition, including as a transfer safeguard tool.",
        "legislative_intent": "To promote consistent, practical, and scalable GDPR application across diverse sectors and organization sizes (including MSMEs), while ensuring oversight through supervisory authorities, the EDPB consistency mechanism, and Commission recognition for EU-wide validity."

It also imposes obligations on the competent supervisory authority to submit draft accreditation criteria to the European Data Protection Board under the consistency mechanism. The monitoring body must take appropriate action for infringements (including suspension or exclusion from the code) and must inform the competent supervisory authority of actions and reasons.

        "brief_summary": "Establishes a voluntary, transparent GDPR certification framework (including seals/marks) to demonstrate compliance, sets rules for issuance, duration, renewal and withdrawal, and enables certain certifications to support appropriate safeguards for international transfers by non-GDPR-subject entities, with an EU-wide register maintained by the EDPB.",
        "detailed_explanation": "Article 42 requires EU institutions and bodies involved in GDPR governance (Member States, supervisory authorities, the Board, and the Commission) to encourage the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms, seals and marks, particularly at Union level, to demonstrate GDPR compliance by controllers and processors, taking into account the needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. It further allows (in addition to certifications for GDPR-subject controllers/processors) the establishment of certification mechanisms/seals/marks approved under Article 42(5) to demonstrate the existence of appropriate safeguards for controllers/processors not subject to GDPR under Article 3, specifically in the context of transfers to third countries or international organisations under Article 46(2)(f). Such non-subject entities must make binding and enforceable commitments via contractual or other legally binding instruments to apply the safeguards, including regarding data subject rights. Certification is explicitly voluntary and must be available via a transparent process. Certification does not reduce the controller/processor responsibility for GDPR compliance and does not prejudice supervisory authorities’ tasks and powers under Articles 55 or 56. Certifications must be issued by accredited certification bodies (Article 43) or by the competent supervisory authority, based on criteria approved by the competent supervisory authority (Article 58(3)) or by the Board (Article 63); Board-approved criteria may result in a common certification called the European Data Protection Seal. Applicants must provide the certification body/supervisory authority with all information and access necessary to conduct the certification procedure. Certifications are valid for a maximum of three years, renewable under the same conditions if requirements continue to be met, and must be withdrawn where requirements are not or are no longer met. The Board must collate all certification mechanisms and seals/marks in a register and make them publicly available by appropriate means.",

        "detailed_explanation": "The provision requires that certification bodies with appropriate data protection expertise may issue and renew GDPR certifications, but must first inform the competent supervisory authority to enable it to exercise its powers where necessary. Member States must ensure such bodies are accredited either by the competent supervisory authority or by the national accreditation body under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, applying EN-ISO/IEC 17065/2012 plus additional supervisory authority requirements. Accreditation is conditional on demonstrated independence and expertise, commitment to approved certification criteria, establishment of procedures for issuing/review/withdrawal of certifications and for complaint handling with transparency, and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Accreditation must be based on criteria approved by the competent supervisory authority or the EDPB; where national accreditation bodies accredit, requirements must complement Regulation 765/2008 and relevant technical rules. Certification bodies are responsible for proper assessment leading to certification/withdrawal, without prejudice to controller/processor responsibility for GDPR compliance. Accreditation lasts up to five years and may be renewed if requirements continue to be met. Certification bodies must provide supervisory authorities reasons for granting/withdrawing requested certification. Supervisory authorities must publish requirements and criteria and transmit them to the EDPB, which must maintain a public register of certification mechanisms and seals/marks. Accreditation must be revoked by the competent supervisory authority or national accreditation body if conditions are not/no longer met or if the certification body’s actions infringe the GDPR. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts specifying requirements for certification mechanisms and may adopt implementing acts setting technical standards and recognition/promotion mechanisms, using the examination procedure.",

It specifies that such transfers do not require specific authorisation. It then prescribes the factors the Commission must consider when assessing adequacy, including rule of law, human rights, relevant legislation (including public security/defence/national security/criminal law and public authority access to data), implementation of laws, data protection rules, professional rules, security measures, onward transfer rules, case-law, enforceable data subject rights, and effective administrative and judicial redress. It also requires consideration of independent supervisory authorities and international commitments. The Commission may adopt adequacy decisions via implementing acts that must include a periodic review mechanism at least every four years, specify territorial/sectoral scope, and identify relevant supervisory authorities where applicable, using the examination procedure. The Commission must continuously monitor developments that could affect adequacy decisions (including legacy decisions under Directive 95/46/EC). Where information shows adequacy is no longer ensured, the Commission must, to the extent necessary, repeal, amend, or suspend the decision via implementing acts without retroactive effect, with an urgency procedure available on duly justified imperative grounds. The Commission must consult with the third country/international organisation to remedy the situation. Decisions to repeal/amend/suspend do not prejudice transfers under GDPR Articles 46–49. The Commission must publish lists of jurisdictions/sectors/international organisations for which adequacy is ensured or no longer ensured. Legacy adequacy decisions under Directive 95/46/EC remain in force until amended/replaced/repealed under the GDPR procedure.",
        "purpose": "To provide a streamlined, legally certain mechanism for international transfers where the recipient jurisdiction/organisation provides an essentially equivalent level of data protection, while ensuring ongoing oversight and the ability to react to changes.",
        "legislative_intent": "To enable cross-border data flows without case-by-case authorisations when adequacy is established, and to ensure adequacy decisions are evidence-based, periodically reviewed, monitored, transparent, and reversible when protection is no longer adequate."

        "detailed_explanation": "This section establishes a conditional permission framework for international transfers when there is no adequacy decision under Article 45(3). It imposes a baseline condition: transfers may occur only if (i) the controller or processor provides 'appropriate safeguards' and (ii) 'enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.' It then enumerates safeguard mechanisms that can be used without any specific supervisory authority authorisation (e.g., legally binding instruments between public authorities, BCRs, Commission SCCs, supervisory authority SCCs approved by the Commission, approved codes of conduct with binding commitments, and approved certification mechanisms with binding commitments). It further provides that certain other safeguards (notably ad hoc contractual clauses and certain administrative arrangements) require prior authorisation from the competent supervisory authority, and mandates that the supervisory authority apply the Article 63 consistency mechanism in those authorisation cases. Finally, it contains transitional provisions preserving the validity of certain authorisations and Commission decisions made under Directive 95/46/EC until amended/replaced/repealed by the relevant authority under the GDPR framework.",

        "brief_summary": "Provides limited derogations allowing international transfers of personal data in the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, subject to strict conditions, transparency, notification, and documentation requirements.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This section regulates when a controller may transfer (or set of transfers) personal data to a third country or an international organisation without relying on (i) an adequacy decision under Article 45(3) or (ii) appropriate safeguards under Article 46 (including binding corporate rules). It establishes an exhaustive list of derogation conditions (explicit consent with risk information; contractual necessity with the data subject; contract in the data subject’s interest; important public interest; legal claims; vital interests where consent cannot be given; and transfers from certain public registers subject to consultation conditions). If none of Articles 45/46 bases or the listed derogations apply, it permits a narrow residual transfer mechanism only when the transfer is non-repetitive, limited in data subjects, necessary for compelling legitimate interests not overridden by the data subject’s interests/rights/freedoms, and after an assessment with suitable safeguards; it also imposes supervisory authority notification and enhanced transparency to the data subject. Additional constraints apply to register-based transfers (no entirety of data or categories; request/recipient limitation). Certain derogations and the residual mechanism are disapplied for public authorities acting in exercise of public powers. The 'public interest' derogation must be recognised in Union or applicable Member State law. Union/Member State law may expressly set limits for important public interest reasons on transfers of specific categories of personal data, and Member States must notify such provisions to the Commission. Controllers/processors must document the assessment and safeguards in Article 30 records.",
        "purpose": "To allow narrowly tailored international transfers in exceptional situations while maintaining protection for data subjects when standard transfer mechanisms (adequacy or safeguards) are unavailable.",
        "legislative_intent": "To ensure international transfers occur only under clearly defined, exceptional conditions with accountability, transparency, and oversight, preventing routine circumvention of adequacy/safeguards requirements."

        "detailed_explanation": "The section establishes enforceable governance safeguards for supervisory authorities. It mandates that each supervisory authority must act with \"complete independence\" when performing tasks and exercising powers under the Regulation. It further requires that the authority’s member(s) remain free from any external influence (direct or indirect) and must neither seek nor take instructions from any person. It imposes conduct and conflict-of-interest style restrictions: members must refrain from actions incompatible with their duties and must not engage in any incompatible occupation during their term, regardless of whether the occupation is paid or unpaid. The section also imposes obligations on each Member State to ensure the authority has adequate human, technical, and financial resources, premises, and infrastructure to perform its tasks and powers effectively, explicitly including activities related to mutual assistance, cooperation, and participation in the Board. Staffing autonomy is required: Member States must ensure each supervisory authority chooses and has its own staff, and that staff are subject exclusively to the direction of the authority’s member(s). Finally, Member States must ensure that any financial control over the authority does not affect its independence and that the authority has separate, public annual budgets (which may be included within the overall state/national budget).",

It specifies that a member’s duties end only upon expiry of term, resignation, or compulsory retirement, and only as provided by the law of the relevant Member State.

        "brief_summary": "Allocates competence between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities for cross-border processing, including a local-handling derogation for matters limited to or substantially affecting one Member State, with mandatory notification, a three-week decision window for the lead authority, and procedural consequences depending on whether the lead authority takes the case.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This section sets out a competence framework for supervisory authorities in cross-border processing scenarios. As a default rule, the supervisory authority of the controller’s or processor’s main establishment (or single establishment) is competent to act as the lead supervisory authority for cross-border processing, using the cooperation procedure in Article 60. A derogation allows a non-lead supervisory authority to handle a complaint lodged with it or a possible infringement when the subject matter relates only to an establishment in its Member State or substantially affects data subjects only in its Member State. When that derogation applies, the local supervisory authority must inform the lead supervisory authority 'without delay'. The lead supervisory authority must then decide within three weeks whether it will handle the case under Article 60, considering whether the controller/processor has an establishment in the informing authority’s Member State. If the lead authority takes the case, Article 60 procedure applies; the informing authority may submit a draft decision, and the lead authority must take 'utmost account' of it when preparing the Article 60(3) draft decision. If the lead authority declines to handle the case, the informing authority handles it under Articles 61 and 62. Finally, the lead supervisory authority is designated as the 'sole interlocutor' of the controller/processor for the cross-border processing carried out by that controller/processor.",
        "purpose": "To ensure clear allocation of supervisory competence and a coordinated enforcement approach for cross-border processing, while preserving the ability of local supervisory authorities to address matters confined to or primarily impacting their Member State.",
        "legislative_intent": "To operationalize the one-stop-shop mechanism by centralizing primary regulatory interaction with a lead authority for cross-border processing, reduce duplicative proceedings, and provide a structured exception and cooperation workflow for local impacts."

        "detailed_explanation": "The article imposes a comprehensive set of mandatory tasks on each supervisory authority within its territory. These tasks include monitoring and enforcing GDPR compliance; promoting public and organizational awareness; advising national institutions on legislative/administrative measures; responding to data subject requests for information about rights; handling and investigating complaints (including those brought via representative bodies under Article 80) and informing complainants of progress/outcome within a reasonable period; cooperating with other supervisory authorities through information sharing and mutual assistance to ensure consistent application; conducting investigations including based on information from other authorities; monitoring relevant technological and commercial developments affecting personal data protection; adopting standard contractual clauses for processor engagements and certain transfer mechanisms; maintaining a list of processing operations requiring a DPIA; advising on processing operations subject to prior consultation; encouraging and approving codes of conduct; encouraging certification mechanisms and approving certification criteria and periodically reviewing certifications; drafting/publishing accreditation criteria and conducting accreditation for code-monitoring bodies and certification bodies; authorising certain contractual clauses for transfers; approving binding corporate rules; contributing to the EDPB; keeping internal records of infringements and measures taken; and performing any other tasks related to personal data protection. The article also requires supervisory authorities to facilitate complaint submission (including via electronic forms), to perform tasks free of charge for data subjects (and where applicable DPOs), and allows charging a reasonable administrative-cost-based fee or refusing to act only where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (especially repetitive), with the burden on the authority to demonstrate that condition.",
        "purpose": "To ensure supervisory authorities have clear, enforceable duties to protect individuals’ rights and ensure consistent GDPR application and enforcement.",
        "legislative_intent": "To operationalize GDPR oversight by mandating concrete supervisory authority functions (enforcement, guidance, cooperation, complaint handling, and governance of compliance tools like codes/certification and transfer instruments) and to ensure accessibility of supervisory authority services while preventing abuse through unfounded/excessive requests."

        "detailed_explanation": "Article 58 mandates that each supervisory authority possess enumerated powers grouped into: (i) investigative powers enabling information gathering, audits, certification review, infringement notification, access to personal data and necessary information, and access to premises/equipment subject to procedural law; (ii) corrective powers enabling warnings, reprimands, orders to comply with data subject requests, orders to bring processing into compliance (including specifying manner and timeframe), orders to communicate breaches to data subjects, processing limitations/bans, rectification/erasure/restriction orders with downstream recipient notification, certification withdrawal or directions to certification bodies, administrative fines under Article 83, and suspension of international data flows; (iii) authorisation/advisory powers including prior consultation advice, issuing opinions to public bodies and the public, authorising certain processing where Member State law requires, approving codes of conduct, accrediting certification bodies, issuing certifications and approving certification criteria, adopting standard contractual clauses for certain contexts, authorising certain transfer clauses and administrative arrangements, and approving binding corporate rules. The exercise of these powers must be subject to safeguards including effective judicial remedy and due process under Union/Member State law consistent with the Charter. Member States must provide by law that supervisory authorities can bring infringements to judicial authorities and, where appropriate, commence or otherwise engage in legal proceedings to enforce the GDPR. Member States may also grant additional powers, but their exercise must not impair the effective operation of Chapter VII.",

        "detailed_explanation": "The article mandates that the lead supervisory authority (LSA) and other supervisory authorities concerned (CSAs) cooperate to reach consensus and exchange all relevant information. It empowers the LSA to request mutual assistance and conduct joint operations for investigations/monitoring in other Member States. It requires the LSA to promptly share relevant information, circulate draft decisions for opinion, and consider CSA views. It defines a structured objection process: CSAs have four weeks to raise a 'relevant and reasoned objection'; if the LSA does not follow it or disputes its relevance/reasoning, the matter must be referred to the GDPR consistency mechanism. If the LSA intends to follow the objection, it must issue a revised draft decision, which is again subject to objection within two weeks. If no objection is raised within the applicable period, authorities are deemed in agreement and bound by the draft decision. The LSA must adopt and notify the decision to the controller/processor’s main or single establishment and inform CSAs and the EDPB, including a summary of facts and grounds; the authority receiving the complaint must inform the complainant. A derogation applies where a complaint is dismissed/rejected: the complaint-receiving authority adopts and notifies that decision to the complainant and informs the controller. Where authorities agree to dismiss/reject parts and act on other parts, separate decisions must be adopted for each part, with allocation of adoption/notification duties between the LSA and the complainant’s authority. After notification of the LSA decision, the controller/processor must take necessary measures to ensure compliance across all EU establishments and must notify the LSA of measures taken; the LSA informs CSAs. In exceptional circumstances where a CSA considers urgent action is needed to protect data subjects, the urgency procedure applies. Information exchange under the article must be by electronic means using a standardised format.",

        "detailed_explanation": "The provision requires supervisory authorities to cooperate by providing each other relevant information and assistance necessary for consistent implementation and application of the GDPR. Mutual assistance explicitly includes handling information requests and taking supervisory measures upon request (including prior authorisations/consultations, inspections, and investigations). A requested authority must take all appropriate measures to respond without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receiving the request, potentially including transmitting information about an investigation’s conduct. Requests must include all necessary information (including purpose and reasons), and any information exchanged is strictly limited to use for the purpose for which it was requested. Refusal is tightly constrained to two grounds: lack of competence for the subject matter/measures, or where compliance would infringe the GDPR or other applicable Union/Member State law. The requested authority must communicate results or progress and must justify any refusal. As a default, information should be supplied electronically using a standardised format. No fee may be charged for actions taken under mutual assistance, though authorities may agree indemnification rules for specific expenditure in exceptional circumstances. If the requested authority fails to provide the information referred to in the results/progress obligation within one month, the requesting authority may adopt a provisional measure in its territory under Article 55(1), and urgency under Article 66(1) is presumed, requiring an urgent binding decision from the Board under Article 66(2). The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts specifying formats/procedures and electronic exchange arrangements (including the standardised format), using the examination procedure under Article 93(2).",

        "brief_summary": "Requires supervisory authorities to cooperate through joint operations (including investigations and enforcement), grants participation rights to concerned authorities in multi-Member-State cases, regulates cross-border secondment and exercise of investigative powers, allocates liability for seconded staff and reimbursement between Member States for damages, and provides an escalation mechanism enabling provisional measures if an authority fails to cooperate within one month, with presumed urgency under the GDPR urgency procedure.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This section imposes operational cooperation duties on EU data protection supervisory authorities when cross-border processing affects multiple Member States. It mandates that supervisory authorities conduct joint operations where appropriate, and ensures that each supervisory authority of Member States with relevant establishments or substantially affected data subjects has a right to participate. It places a procedural duty on the competent supervisory authority (as determined under GDPR Article 56(1) or (4)) to invite other concerned supervisory authorities and to respond without delay to participation requests. It further regulates how investigative powers may be conferred on or exercised by seconded staff from another Member State, subject to authorisation and the host Member State’s law, and requires that such powers be exercised only under the guidance and in the presence of host authority staff. The section also establishes a liability framework: the host Member State assumes responsibility (including liability) for actions of seconded staff operating in its territory; the Member State where damage occurs must compensate under conditions applicable to its own staff; and the seconding Member State must reimburse the host Member State in full for sums paid to injured persons. Finally, it limits reimbursement claims between Member States (except as specified) and provides an enforcement backstop: if a supervisory authority does not comply within one month with the obligation to respond to participation requests for an intended joint operation, other supervisory authorities may adopt provisional measures in that authority’s territory under Article 55, with urgency presumed under Article 66(1), triggering the need for an EDPB opinion or urgent binding decision under Article 66(2).",
        "purpose": "To ensure effective, coordinated, and legally structured cross-border supervision and enforcement of data protection rules across the EU, including clear operational procedures and liability allocation for joint actions.",
        "legislative_intent": "To prevent fragmented enforcement in cross-border cases by enabling joint investigations/enforcement, guaranteeing participation of concerned authorities, and providing a rapid escalation path when cooperation fails, while clarifying legal responsibility for seconded staff actions."

        "brief_summary": "Establishes when and how the Board must issue an opinion on certain draft measures by supervisory authorities and on certain cross-border/general-application matters, including timelines, information exchange format, publication, and follow-up obligations for supervisory authorities.",
        "detailed_explanation": "The provision mandates that the Board issue an opinion when a competent supervisory authority intends to adopt specified measures (including DPIA lists, code-of-conduct compliance determinations, accreditation criteria approvals, standard clauses determinations, authorization of certain transfer clauses, and approval of binding corporate rules). It also allows any supervisory authority, the Board Chair, or the Commission to request Board examination of matters of general application or producing effects in more than one Member State, particularly where a supervisory authority fails to comply with mutual assistance or joint operations obligations. The Board must adopt its opinion within a defined period (eight weeks, extendable by six weeks for complexity) by simple majority, with a deemed-agreement mechanism for members who do not object within a Chair-indicated reasonable period. The section imposes standardized electronic communication duties on supervisory authorities and the Commission to provide relevant information to the Board, and requires the Chair to inform Board members and the Commission and to publish the opinion. It prohibits the competent supervisory authority from adopting the relevant draft decision during the Board opinion period. After receiving the opinion, the supervisory authority must take 'utmost account' of it and must communicate within two weeks whether it will maintain or amend the draft decision, including any amended draft decision, using a standardized electronic format. If the supervisory authority indicates it does not intend to follow the opinion (in whole or in part) and provides grounds, the dispute resolution mechanism under Article 65(1) applies.",
        "purpose": "To ensure consistent application of the GDPR across Member States through a formal Board opinion process on key measures and cross-border matters, supported by standardized information exchange and enforceable timelines.",
        "legislative_intent": "To operationalize the GDPR consistency mechanism by requiring Board involvement in specified high-impact supervisory authority measures and by creating procedural safeguards (timelines, voting rules, publication, and escalation to dispute resolution) to prevent divergent national approaches."

        "brief_summary": "Requires the Board to adopt binding decisions in specified cross-border supervisory authority dispute scenarios, sets strict timelines and voting thresholds for adoption, imposes a temporary prohibition on supervisory authorities adopting decisions while the Board is deciding, and mandates notification, publication, and issuance of a final supervisory authority decision based on the Board’s binding decision.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This section establishes a mandatory dispute-resolution mechanism within the GDPR consistency framework. It defines (i) the triggering situations in which the Board must intervene and issue a binding decision, (ii) the scope of what the binding decision must address (all matters subject to a relevant and reasoned objection, including whether there is an infringement), (iii) procedural deadlines and voting rules for adopting the binding decision (including extensions and fallback voting rules if deadlines are missed), (iv) a standstill obligation preventing supervisory authorities concerned from adopting a decision on the submitted subject matter while the Board’s decision-making period runs, (v) notification obligations by the Chair and information to the Commission, (vi) publication timing on the Board’s website, and (vii) the obligation for the lead supervisory authority (or the authority with which the complaint was lodged) to adopt a final decision based on the Board’s binding decision within a set deadline, including required references and attachments to the Board decision and reporting back to the Board on notification dates.",
        "purpose": "To ensure the correct and consistent application of the GDPR in individual cross-border cases by resolving disagreements between supervisory authorities through a binding Board decision.",
        "legislative_intent": "To prevent divergent enforcement outcomes across Member States by centralizing resolution of key disputes (objections to draft decisions, competence disputes, and failures to seek/follow Board opinions) and by imposing uniform timelines, voting rules, and binding effect."

        "brief_summary": "Provides a derogation-based urgent pathway for supervisory authorities to adopt immediate provisional measures with legal effect in their territory for up to three months, and enables urgent escalation to the EDPB for an urgent opinion or binding decision within two weeks by simple majority.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This provision creates a specific procedural mechanism for exceptional urgent situations. It allows a supervisory authority concerned to bypass (\"by way of derogation\") the ordinary GDPR cooperation/consistency processes (including the consistency mechanism and the one-stop-shop cooperation procedure) to immediately adopt provisional measures that have legal effects within its own territory. These measures must have a specified validity period not exceeding three months. The authority must promptly communicate both the measures and the reasons for adopting them to other concerned supervisory authorities, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB/\"the Board\"), and the European Commission. If the authority believes final measures must urgently be adopted after taking provisional measures, it may request an urgent EDPB opinion or an urgent binding decision, providing reasons. Additionally, any supervisory authority may request urgent EDPB intervention where a competent supervisory authority has not taken an appropriate measure despite an urgent need to act to protect data subjects. Urgent EDPB outputs under this procedure must be adopted within two weeks and are decided by simple majority, notwithstanding longer timelines or different rules referenced in Articles 64(3) and 65(2).",

It highlights that these arrangements include, \"in particular\", the standardised format referenced in Article 64, indicating that the implementing acts may specify a standardised format and potentially other operational/technical arrangements for electronic exchange. The provision further constrains the adoption process by requiring that the implementing acts \"shall be adopted\" under the examination procedure referenced in Article 93(2), thereby mandating a specific comitology procedure for these acts.",

        "brief_summary": "Requires the Board to act independently in carrying out its legally assigned tasks and powers, and prohibits it from seeking or accepting instructions, with an explicit reservation regarding certain Commission requests referenced elsewhere.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This section imposes two core, actionable governance requirements on the Board. First, it mandates that the Board \"shall act independently\" when it performs its tasks or exercises its powers, but limits that mandate to the context of tasks/powers exercised \"pursuant to Articles 70 and 71\". Second, it establishes an operational independence rule: in performing tasks or exercising powers, the Board \"shall, ... neither seek nor take instructions from anybody.\" This prohibition is qualified by a carve-out: \"Without prejudice to requests by the Commission referred to in point (b) of Article 70(1) and in Article 70(2)\"—meaning the independence rule must be applied in a way that does not undermine or negate those Commission requests as referenced in those provisions. The section does not define 'instructions', 'anybody', or the nature of the Commission requests; it only sets the independence standard and the instruction prohibition with the stated reservation.",
        "purpose": "To ensure the Board’s decision-making and exercise of powers are free from external direction or influence, preserving impartiality and autonomy in executing its mandate.",
        "legislative_intent": "To structurally insulate the Board from external instructions while acknowledging that certain Commission requests (as referenced in Article 70(1)(b) and Article 70(2)) remain relevant and must not be prejudiced by the independence principle."

These tasks include monitoring correct application in cases under Articles 64 and 65 (without prejudice to national supervisory authorities), advising the Commission on data protection issues and specific procedural/format matters (e.g., information exchange for binding corporate rules), issuing guidelines/recommendations/best practices on multiple GDPR operational areas (erasure of links under Article 17(2), profiling decisions under Article 22(2), breach notification timing and circumstances under Article 33, high-risk breach criteria under Article 34, transfer criteria under Article 47 and Article 49(1), supervisory authority measures and administrative fines under Articles 58 and 83, and reporting procedures for infringements under Article 54(2)). It also includes tasks to encourage codes of conduct and certification mechanisms (Articles 40 and 42), to accredit certification bodies and maintain public registers (Article 43 and related provisions), to provide opinions to the Commission on certification requirements, icons, and adequacy assessments (including a duty on the Commission to provide necessary documentation), to issue opinions and binding decisions under the consistency mechanism (Articles 64–66), to promote cooperation/training/knowledge exchange among supervisory authorities, to issue opinions on Union-level codes of conduct, and to maintain a publicly accessible electronic register of decisions related to the consistency mechanism. Procedurally, when the Commission requests advice it may set a time limit; the Board must forward outputs to the Commission and the Article 93 committee and make them public; and the Board must consult interested parties where appropriate, allow comments within a reasonable period, and make consultation results publicly available (without prejudice to Article 76).",

Additionally, Article 71 prescribes minimum content for the annual report: it \"shall include a review of the practical application\" of (i) the Board’s \"guidelines, recommendations and best practices\" referenced in Article 70(1)(l), and (ii) the Board’s \"binding decisions\" referenced in Article 65.",

It requires the secretariat to act exclusively under the Chair’s instructions, ensuring functional direction by the Board’s leadership rather than the EDPS’s own operational hierarchy. It further requires organizational separation: EDPS staff performing Board tasks must be subject to separate reporting lines from EDPS staff performing EDPS tasks, supporting independence and avoiding conflicts of interest. Additionally, where appropriate, the Board and EDPS must establish and publish a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) implementing the article, defining cooperation terms and applying to EDPS staff involved in Board tasks. The secretariat must provide analytical, administrative, and logistical support and is specifically responsible for a detailed list of operational tasks including day-to-day business, communications with Board members/Chair/Commission, communications with other institutions and the public, use of electronic means for communications, translation, meeting preparation and follow-up, and preparation/drafting/publication of Board outputs (opinions, dispute-settlement decisions between supervisory authorities, and other adopted texts).",

        "detailed_explanation": "This section creates judicial recourse against supervisory authorities. First, it guarantees that any natural or legal person affected by a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority can seek an effective judicial remedy, without limiting other administrative or non-judicial options. Second, it separately guarantees data subjects a judicial remedy when the competent supervisory authority (as determined under GDPR competence rules) fails to handle a complaint or fails to inform the data subject within a defined time period (three months) about the progress or outcome of a complaint lodged under the GDPR complaint right. Third, it establishes a mandatory forum rule: proceedings against a supervisory authority must be brought in the courts of the Member State where that authority is established. Fourth, where the challenged supervisory authority decision was preceded by a European Data Protection Board (EDPB) opinion or decision under the consistency mechanism, the supervisory authority has a procedural duty to forward that opinion or decision to the court.",

        "detailed_explanation": "The section establishes a structured approach to avoid conflicting judgments and duplicative litigation in cross-border disputes involving processing by the same controller or processor. First, when a competent court has information that proceedings concerning the same subject matter and the same controller/processor are pending in another Member State, it must contact the other court to confirm whether such proceedings exist. Second, if such parallel proceedings are pending, any competent court other than the court first seized is permitted (but not required) to suspend its own proceedings. Third, where the parallel proceedings are pending at first instance, a non-first-seised court may, upon application by one of the parties, decline jurisdiction, but only if two cumulative conditions are met: (i) the court first seized has jurisdiction over the actions in question; and (ii) the law applicable to the first-seised court permits consolidation of the actions. These provisions collectively create a mechanism for judicial deconfliction and potential consolidation centered on the court first seized.",

A controller or processor can avoid liability if it proves it is not responsible for the event causing the damage. Where multiple controllers/processors are involved and responsible, each is liable for the entire damage to ensure effective compensation (joint and several liability). A party that pays full compensation may seek contribution (recourse) from other responsible parties in proportion to their responsibility, subject to the liability conditions.

        "brief_summary": "Establishes how supervisory authorities must impose GDPR administrative fines, including decision criteria, maximum fine levels, aggregation limits for multiple infringements, procedural safeguards, and Member State options for public bodies and court-based fine systems.",
        "detailed_explanation": "This provision mandates that supervisory authorities ensure administrative fines for specified GDPR infringements are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each individual case. It requires authorities to decide whether to impose a fine (in addition to or instead of certain corrective measures) and to determine the fine amount by considering an enumerated list of factors (nature/gravity/duration, intent/negligence, mitigation, responsibility and measures under Articles 25 and 32, prior infringements, cooperation, data categories, how the infringement became known including notification, compliance with prior measures, adherence to codes/certification, and other aggravating/mitigating factors such as financial benefits). It limits total fines for multiple infringements in the same or linked processing operations to the cap for the gravest infringement. It sets two tiers of maximum fines (up to 10,000,000 EUR or 2% worldwide annual turnover; and up to 20,000,000 EUR or 4% worldwide annual turnover) depending on the infringed provisions, and separately reiterates that non-compliance with supervisory authority orders is subject to the higher tier. It allows Member States to define whether and to what extent fines may be imposed on public authorities/bodies established in that Member State. It subjects the exercise of fining powers to procedural safeguards under Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process. Where a Member State legal system lacks administrative fines, it permits an alternative mechanism where the supervisory authority initiates and national courts impose fines, requiring effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness, and obliges those Member States to notify the Commission of adopted provisions by 25 May 2018 and subsequent amendments without delay.",
        "purpose": "To harmonize and structure GDPR enforcement through consistent, fair, and deterrent administrative fines, while ensuring due process and accommodating differing national legal systems.",

It applies where the documents are held by (i) a public authority, (ii) a public body, or (iii) a private body, but only when the private body holds the documents \"for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest\". In those circumstances, the authority/body \"may\" disclose the personal data, but the disclosure must be \"in accordance with Union or Member State law to which the public authority or body is subject\". The stated compliance objective is \"to reconcile public access to official documents with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation.\" This creates (a) a legal-basis dependency on external EU/Member State access-to-documents rules applicable to the disclosing entity, and (b) a balancing requirement: disclosure should be structured to achieve reconciliation between transparency/public access and data protection rights under the Regulation.

It further requires that if the purposes can be fulfilled by further processing that does not permit (or no longer permits) identification of data subjects, then the purposes must be fulfilled in that non-identifying manner. Additionally, it authorizes (but does not itself create) derogations from certain data subject rights, but only where Union or Member State law provides them and only under strict conditions: the derogations must be subject to the safeguards in paragraph 1; the relevant rights must be likely to render impossible or seriously impair achievement of the specific purposes; and the derogations must be necessary for fulfilling those purposes.

The applicability of any such national rules is strictly limited: they \"shall apply only\" with regard to personal data that the controller or processor \"has received as a result of or has obtained in an activity covered by that obligation of secrecy.\" Separately, the provision imposes a mandatory notification duty on each Member State to inform the European Commission of rules adopted under paragraph 1 by a fixed deadline (25 May 2018) and to notify any later amendments \"without delay.\"",

To support the evaluation, the Commission is empowered to request information from Member States and supervisory authorities. When conducting the evaluation/review, the Commission must take into account positions and findings of the European Parliament, the Council, and other relevant bodies or sources.
