It does not state that GDPR applies where it should not, nor does it state that GDPR does not apply where it should. It also does not claim that WhatsApp’s processing is excluded from GDPR scope (e.g., as purely personal/household, outside Union law, or competent-authority law enforcement processing). References to contacting law enforcement (“…contacting law enforcement”) do not assert that WhatsApp is a competent authority or that GDPR is inapplicable.\n\nThe regulation’s specific point about EU institutions being subject to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 is not addressed by the document, but absence of mention is not a contradiction. Therefore, no direct conflict with GDPR Article 2 (material scope) is present."

The document contains general contractual disclaimers and limitation-of-liability clauses, but these are not framed as negating the application of Directive 2000/31/EC, and the Terms also include a general savings clause indicating compliance with law.

However, the document does not explicitly claim it will process personal data without a lawful basis, does not assert a legal basis that conflicts with Article 6, and does not state that it will rely on legitimate interests in a way prohibited for public authorities.

This does not state that WhatsApp will rely on a child’s consent below the applicable threshold without parental authorisation, nor does it set an EU age threshold below 16. The document also does not contain any statement permitting consent-based processing of under-16 children without parental involvement.\n\nWhile the document does not explicitly describe “reasonable efforts to verify” parental responsibility (an obligation under Article 8 when parental consent is required), omission is not treated as a contradiction under the provided rules.

Because the document does not directly state anything opposite to Article 17’s requirements, no contradiction is identified."

Instead, it generally references the Privacy Policy for user rights and includes a non-limitation clause stating the Terms are not intended to limit non-waivable data subject rights.\n\nBecause the document contains no explicit statement that is opposite to, or permits what Article 18 forbids, no direct contradiction is identified."
