Information must be provided in writing or electronically, and orally if requested and identity is verified. Controllers must facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15-22, and cannot refuse requests unless they cannot identify the data subject. Responses to requests must be provided without undue delay and within one month, extendable by two months if necessary, with reasons for delay communicated. If no action is taken, the data subject must be informed of reasons and their right to complain or seek judicial remedy. Information and actions must be free of charge unless requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case a reasonable fee may be charged or the request refused, with the burden of proof on the controller. Controllers may request additional information to verify identity if in doubt. Information may be provided with standardized icons, which must be machine-readable if electronic.

Upon objection, the controller must cease processing unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing is necessary for legal claims. For direct marketing purposes, including related profiling, the data subject has an unconditional right to object, and the controller must stop processing for these purposes. The right to object must be explicitly communicated to the data subject at the latest at the time of first communication and must be presented clearly and separately. In the context of information society services, the right may be exercised by automated means. For processing for scientific, historical, or statistical purposes under Article 89(1), the right to object applies unless processing is necessary for public interest tasks.",

It requires that processing by a processor be governed by a binding contract or legal act, specifying the processing's subject-matter, duration, nature, purpose, data types, data subject categories, and the obligations and rights of the controller. The processor must only act on documented instructions, ensure confidentiality, take security measures (per Article 32), assist the controller in fulfilling data subject rights and compliance obligations, delete or return data after processing, and allow audits. Sub-processors may only be engaged with controller authorization, and the same obligations must be imposed on them.

The DPIA must assess the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. The regulation specifies scenarios where a DPIA is mandatory, such as systematic and extensive evaluation based on automated processing (including profiling), large-scale processing of special categories of data or data relating to criminal convictions, and systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas. The controller must seek advice from the DPO (if designated), and the assessment must include a description of processing, assessment of necessity and proportionality, risk assessment, and measures to address risks. Supervisory authorities are required to publish lists of processing operations that require or do not require a DPIA and must communicate these to the European Data Protection Board. There are exceptions where a DPIA is not required if already conducted as part of a general impact assessment under certain legal bases. Controllers must review DPIAs when risks change.",

The Commission must periodically review adequacy decisions, monitor ongoing developments, and may amend, suspend, or repeal decisions if adequacy is no longer ensured.

The article also allows any supervisory authority, the Chair of the Board, or the European Commission to request an opinion on matters of general application or cross-border effect, especially in cases of non-compliance with mutual assistance or joint operations obligations. The Board must issue its opinion within a set timeframe, and supervisory authorities must take utmost account of the opinion, communicating their final decision and rationale.

The authority must promptly communicate these measures and the reasons for them to other concerned supervisory authorities, the EDPB, and the European Commission. If final measures are urgently needed, the authority may request an urgent opinion or binding decision from the EDPB, providing reasons. Any supervisory authority may also request such urgent action if a competent authority has not acted appropriately.

It specifies that fines may be imposed in addition to or instead of other corrective measures, and lists detailed criteria for determining whether to impose a fine and its amount. The article sets two tiers of maximum fines (10 million EUR/2% turnover and 20 million EUR/4% turnover) depending on the nature of the infringement. It also addresses the treatment of multiple infringements, the application to public authorities, procedural safeguards, and alternative enforcement mechanisms in Member States where administrative fines are not directly available.",

Pseudonymisation is suggested as one such measure, provided the purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where the purposes can be achieved without identifying data subjects, processing must be done in a way that does not permit identification. The article allows Union or Member State law to provide for derogations from certain data subject rights (Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 21) if exercising those rights would render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the purposes, and only if such derogations are necessary and subject to safeguards.
